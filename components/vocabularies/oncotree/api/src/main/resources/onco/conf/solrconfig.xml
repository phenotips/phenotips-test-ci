       affect both how text is indexed and queried.

  <!-- Data Directory

       Used to specify an alternate directory to hold all index data

  <!-- The DirectoryFactory to use for indexes.

       solr.StandardDirectoryFactory is filesystem
       based and tries to pick the best implementation for the current
       JVM and platform.  solr.NRTCachingDirectoryFactory, the default,
       wraps solr.StandardDirectoryFactory and caches small files in memory
       for better NRT performance.

       One can force a particular implementation via solr.MMapDirectoryFactory,
       solr.NIOFSDirectoryFactory, or solr.SimpleFSDirectoryFactory.

       solr.RAMDirectoryFactory is memory based, not
       persistent, and doesn't work with replication.
    -->
  <directoryFactory name="DirectoryFactory"
                    class="${solr.directoryFactory:solr.NRTCachingDirectoryFactory}">
  </directoryFactory>

  <!-- The CodecFactory for defining the format of the inverted index.
       The default implementation is SchemaCodecFactory, which is the official Lucene
       index format, but hooks into the schema to provide per-field customization of
       the postings lists and per-document values in the fieldType element
       (postingsFormat/docValuesFormat). Note that most of the alternative implementations
       are experimental, so if you choose to customize the index format, it's a good
       idea to convert back to the official format e.g. via IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader)
       before upgrading to a newer version to avoid unnecessary reindexing.
       A "compressionMode" string element can be added to <codecFactory> to choose
       between the existing compression modes in the default codec: "BEST_SPEED" (default)
       or "BEST_COMPRESSION".
  -->
  <codecFactory class="solr.SchemaCodecFactory"/>

  <!-- To disable dynamic schema REST APIs, use the following for <schemaFactory>:

       <schemaFactory class="ClassicIndexSchemaFactory"/>

       When ManagedIndexSchemaFactory is specified instead, Solr will load the schema from
       the resource named in 'managedSchemaResourceName', rather than from schema.xml.
       Note that the managed schema resource CANNOT be named schema.xml.  If the managed
       schema does not exist, Solr will create it after reading schema.xml, then rename
       'schema.xml' to 'schema.xml.bak'.

       Do NOT hand edit the managed schema - external modifications will be ignored and
       overwritten as a result of schema modification REST API calls.

       When ManagedIndexSchemaFactory is specified with mutable = true, schema
       modification REST API calls will be allowed; otherwise, error responses will be
       sent back for these requests.

                  another process trying to modify the index.
         native = NativeFSLockFactory - uses OS native file locking.
                  Do not use when multiple solr webapps in the same
                  JVM are attempting to share a single index.
         simple = SimpleFSLockFactory  - uses a plain file for locking

         Defaults: 'native' is default for Solr3.6 and later, otherwise
                   'simple' is the default

    <!-- Solr Internal Query Caches

         There are two implementations of cache available for Solr,
         LRUCache, based on a synchronized LinkedHashMap, and
         FastLRUCache, based on a ConcurrentHashMap.

         FastLRUCache has faster gets and slower puts in single
         threaded operation and thus is generally faster than LRUCache
         when the hit ratio of the cache is high (> 75%), and may be
         faster under other scenarios on multi-cpu systems.
    -->

    <!-- Filter Cache

         Cache used by SolrIndexSearcher for filters (DocSets),
         unordered sets of *all* documents that match a query.  When a
         new searcher is opened, its caches may be prepopulated or
         "autowarmed" using data from caches in the old searcher.
         autowarmCount is the number of items to prepopulate.  For
         LRUCache, the autowarmed items will be the most recently
         accessed items.

         Parameters:
           class - the SolrCache implementation LRUCache or
               (LRUCache or FastLRUCache)
           size - the maximum number of entries in the cache
           initialSize - the initial capacity (number of entries) of
               the cache.  (see java.util.HashMap)
           autowarmCount - the number of entries to prepopulate from

    <!-- Document Cache

         Caches Lucene Document objects (the stored fields for each
         document).  Since Lucene internal document ids are transient,
         this cache will not be autowarmed.

    <!-- Result Window Size

         An optimization for use with the queryResultCache.  When a search
         is requested, a superset of the requested number of document ids
         are collected.  For example, if a search for a particular query
         requests matching documents 10 through 19, and queryWindowSize is 50,
         then documents 0 through 49 will be collected and cached.  Any further
         requests in that range can be satisfied via the cache.

    <!-- Use Cold Searcher

         If a search request comes in and there is no current
         registered searcher, then immediately register the still
         warming searcher and use it.  If "false" then all requests
         will block until the first searcher is done warming.

  <!-- Request Dispatcher

       This section contains instructions for how the SolrDispatchFilter
       should behave when processing requests for this SolrCore.

       handleSelect is a legacy option that affects the behavior of requests
       such as /select?qt=XXX

       handleSelect="true" will cause the SolrDispatchFilter to process
       the request and dispatch the query to a handler specified by the
       "qt" param, assuming "/select" isn't already registered.

       handleSelect="false" will cause the SolrDispatchFilter to
       ignore "/select" requests, resulting in a 404 unless a handler
       is explicitly registered with the name "/select"

       handleSelect="true" is not recommended for new users, but is the default
       for backwards compatibility
    -->
  <requestDispatcher handleSelect="false" >
    <!-- Request Parsing

         These settings indicate how Solr Requests may be parsed, and
         what restrictions may be placed on the ContentStreams from
         those requests

         enableRemoteStreaming - enables use of the stream.file
         and stream.url parameters for specifying remote streams.

         multipartUploadLimitInKB - specifies the max size (in KiB) of
         Multipart File Uploads that Solr will allow in a Request.

         formdataUploadLimitInKB - specifies the max size (in KiB) of
         form data (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) sent via
         POST. You can use POST to pass request parameters not
         fitting into the URL.

         addHttpRequestToContext - if set to true, it will instruct
         the requestParsers to include the original HttpServletRequest
         object in the context map of the SolrQueryRequest under the
         key "httpRequest". It will not be used by any of the existing
         Solr components, but may be useful when developing custom
         plugins.

         *** WARNING ***
         The settings below authorize Solr to fetch remote files, You
         should make sure your system has some authentication before
         using enableRemoteStreaming="true"

    <!-- HTTP Caching

         Set HTTP caching related parameters (for proxy caches and clients).

         The options below instruct Solr not to output any HTTP Caching
         related headers

    <httpCaching never304="true" />

  <!-- Request Handlers

       http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrRequestHandler

       Incoming queries will be dispatched to a specific handler by name
       based on the path specified in the request.

       Legacy behavior: If the request path uses "/select" but no Request
       Handler has that name, and if handleSelect="true" has been specified in
       the requestDispatcher, then the Request Handler is dispatched based on
       the qt parameter.  Handlers without a leading '/' are accessed this way
       like so: http://host/app/[core/]select?qt=name  If no qt is
       given, then the requestHandler that declares default="true" will be
       used or the one named "standard".

       If a Request Handler is declared with startup="lazy", then it will
       not be initialized until the first request that uses it.
